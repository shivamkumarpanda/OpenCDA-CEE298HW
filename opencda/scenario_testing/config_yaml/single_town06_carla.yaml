  Content: This is the scenario testing configuration file for single vehicle testing in town06 with perception/localization activated

# First define the basic parameters of the vehicles
vehicle_base:
  sensing:
    perception:
      activate: true # when not activated, objects positions will be retrieved from server directly
      camera:
        visualize: 0 # how many camera images need to be visualized. 0 means no visualization for camera
        num: 0 # how many cameras are mounted on the vehicle. Maximum 3(frontal, left and right cameras)
        # relative positions (x,y,z,yaw) of the camera. len(positions) should be equal to camera num
        positions: []

    localization:
      activate: true # when not activated, ego position will be retrieved from server directly
      delta: 0.01
      debug_helper:
        show_animation: true # whether to show real-time trajectory plotting

  behavior:
    ignore_traffic_light: false # whether to ignore traffic light
    collision_time_ahead: 2.0 # used for collision checking


# define the background traffic control by carla
carla_traffic_manager:
  random: true # whether to random select vehicles' color and model
  ignore_lights_percentage: 0 # whether set the traffic ignore traffic lights
  vehicle_list: ~  # a number or a list
  # Used only when vehicle_list is a number.
  # x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, x_step, y_step
